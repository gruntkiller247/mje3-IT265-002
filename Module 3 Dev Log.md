Goals for this Module
- [X] Begin brainstorming game ideas for the final project. I plan to make a card game with a simliar scope to Yu-Gi-Oh mixed with ideas inspired from Magic The Gathering


 Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I have thought out possible archetypes of cards and various ideas for how they can interact alongside a basic framework of how the game will work.
    I am basing the game around farm animals or the concept of being on a farm, with a max creature/zone count akin to Yu-Gi-Oh, the fast pace tutoring found in yugioh, and the combat system akin to Magic.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  Thinking about how to develop a game even taking inspiration from other games is difficult and once I have to put pen to paper flaws begin to show up.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I will fabricate a basic template for the game then test it with my card game buddies.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  Visual design of games is important. I can not draw and with thus use simple words to represent every thought and action people can experience. Rabbit. Congrats, you made the card art in your head!

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I like the idea from yugioh where there are limited spaces in play, cards can be tutored from deck into play with ease, but the limitation on the combat system found in games like magic where creatures are potential obsticals but not always.


#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  I will be trying to understand more about the game development cycle before I try and list practical aspects of play.
