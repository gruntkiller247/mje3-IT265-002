IT265 Design Treatment Checkpoint ChangeLog:

On the GitHub there is a pdf going over the original intent of the game

As for the digital prototype, I planned to get the core concept + mechanics required to build + run the game to be functional.

So far, I have created:
  The deck system
  Drawing
  Playing cards to rooms
  Rooms recording cards played
  Adding + removing cards from hand
  Combat within rooms
  Priority as a concept exsits but allows plays to be made without it in mind
  Turns
  HP
  Win conditions: There are no game over screens but all text will flash with the winner

Since this is a prototype, I did not implement any cards with practical effects, instead each card has no effect. I feel that with
the current system I could implement effects easily as I have the room know of the card script allowing effects to be applied to rooms and 
cards within.

There were not many conceptual changes from the physical to the digital prototype, mainly the design goal of functionality rather than a true 1 to 1
adaptation due to conflicting school schedules and an extreme dislike of Unity for card games.
