Goals for this Module
    Complete my Digital Prototype
Progress
- What I accomplished:
  I finished my digital prototype in Unity
- Challenges faced:
  - Unity is unruly and converting the game to WebGL has presented problems. Outside the editor, my card gameobject's glow white and obfuscate the gameplay. The game is still playable due to a UI element that tells the players what card has been selected.
 
- Solutions:
  - I have been unable to find a proper solution. I theorize that changing my card gameobjects from gameobjects with a material to sprites I may be able to fix the problem. I lack the knowledge to do this and have other projects taking my priority. 

Learnings
-   Unity is annoying as hell.

Free Thinking
    Unity has too much random stuff that can go wrong that will go wrong.
