Goals for this Module
I do not have any real goals for this module other than learn more about creating custom decks in Unity

 Progress
- What I accomplished
  -I have learned about different methods to implement decks into Unity and have begun theory work on what would be simpliest to use

- Challenges faced:
  - Math is hard, thinking about how things work is hard, implmenting solutions to problems when the solutions are not obvious is hard. 

Learnings
-I have learned how to incorporate different collections for use with decks and about Entities in Unity



 Next Steps
- Work on the digital protoype when I have time
