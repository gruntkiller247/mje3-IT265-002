Goals for this Module
I do not have any real goals for this module other than to learn more about game balance and design for the digital prototype

 Progress
- What I accomplished
  -I have established I am going to use Unity for ease of use, although I plan to use very few graphics so enjoy looking at grey cubes

- Challenges faced:
  - It was either learn something to encapsulate javascript and or python or use Unity. Like water, I took the path of least resistance

Learnings
-I learned about cube maps and polygon?(I can't recall the correct shape) maps and how using math can determine positioning on a digital board.



 Next Steps
- Work on the digital protoype when I have time
