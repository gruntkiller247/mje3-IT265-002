Goals for this Module
    Finalize Farmaggedon

Progress
- What I accomplished:
  I have established a game, its rules, and two decks for physical prototyping

- **Challenges faced**:
    Each time I did something I had to go back and flush out both non game esque descriptors and establish a reason to be for the thing.

- **Solutions**:
    Spoke with many people at my local game store to get a better viewpoint on how people read stuff and what type of balance I should have

Learnings
I learned what sort of pace a game needs and how certain things should be worded to better get the intent of the card accross and clearly dictate what actions should be taken.

Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  Game making is fun yet challenging. Even with broad strokes for what I wanted to build, creating two 50 card decks with opposing themes was a lot harder then I thought. Cheating and make roughly 20 or so cards Identical in both decks is quite a nice thing to be able to do.

Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Creating the physical prototype then ensuring the game is as fun in paper as it is in writing
