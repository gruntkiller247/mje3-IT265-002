  -  <!--I have chosen not to fix the VS Code issue and instead do my assignment within github-->

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  <!--I have always been a fan of emergent gameplay and the golden rule of a game must be fun and exploring the topics around these have been enjoyable-->

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  <!--I could improve my own knowledge by fixing my VS Code. I would also like to design a card game with more emgergent stratagies akin to Yu-Gi-Oh with less restrictions on a mana mechanic and more on allowing the cards to self regulate themselves-->


#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  <!--Fixing VS Code and protyping a card game with these mechanics-->
