Goals for this Module
    My main goal is to complete the Case Study and choose a language to write my digital prototype in
Progress
- What I accomplished:
  I wrote my case study and chose to write my game in HTML/Javascript as I have begun to hate Unity more than I already have being in 3 Unity courses in 1 semester
- Challenges faced:
  - Saved my Case Study to last minute due to shenanigans
 
- Solutions:
  - 3 hour homework event

Learnings
-   Don't forget to look a week ahead when planning homework time, Unity Sucks.

Free Thinking
-Java script is not Java, it is a body changer alien wearing Java's skin

 Next Steps
- Learn enough Java scipt to fake my game(or just make it)
