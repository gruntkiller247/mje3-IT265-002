Goals for this Module
- [X] Learn about colors and how they help determine the appeal of a game


Progress
- What I accomplished:
  - I have thought about some rules for the card game I am going to make for the class.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  I have learned about color patterns and how they can assit and negatively affect game mechanics

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  For the card game I want it to amalgamate the things and play patterns I enjoy from other card games.
    This includes: 
        The balls to the wall comboing that is present in Yu-gi-oh
        The logical battling system presented in games like Magic the Gathering and Star Wars Unlimited
        Cards that have synergies within each other

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  I will be putting pen to paper and trying to write out a few cards and ground rules
