Goals for this Module
    Flush out my design treatment for my game

Progress
- What I accomplished:
  I have a template down for what I want the card game to be played as but I do not have hard written rules and specific test cards.

- **Challenges faced**:
  Making a unique card game is hard, even hard is making it seem fun
- **Solutions**:
  -I played more card games and spoke to people around me about what card games they've loved in the past and what made them fun.

Learnings
- Card games rely a lot on randomness vs depth in terms of how a player chooses their actions. Playing with that in mind vs trying to build a game around these is very differnet and a fun way to look at things.

Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  Without going too deep into the game, I wanted it to take several play patterns or things I enjoyed from other card games. These include:
    Base vs character distinction: "IE" can attack a unit or a player's HP
    Balls to the wall comboing as seen in Yu-gi-oh
    Clearly defined groups/family of units
    Limitation on the use of certain cards per turn
    A priority system that swaps the flow of the game to 1:1 actions per player rathern than a strict turn based system
    A linked homebase system where cards from either player's deck can influence and change the field of battle and potential win conditions rather than each player having an static health pool. This is defined more with the fact that each player will be building off of the singular "base" and adding "rooms" each room either helps just ine player, both players, or can hurt either player

Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Writing out the specifc rules of the game then building cards around it. I prefer to bend rules rather than make cards then make rules.
