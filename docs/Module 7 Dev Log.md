Goals for this Module
    Witness people's game ideas

Progress
- What I accomplished:
  I have finished my game and presented

- **Challenges faced**:
    Explaining a game is hard, even more so when you cannot use evergreen synonyms that exsist within many games

- **Solutions**:
    I spoke with a few of my friends who do not play card games and had them help me explain the concepts without using card game terminology

Learnings
I have learned how to present a topic in a more beginner friendly way

Free Thinking


Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Watching more people present and do work on the game's digital prototype, probably in Unity with minimal graphics
